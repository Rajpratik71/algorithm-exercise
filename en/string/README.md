# String

String related topics are discussed in this chapter.

> **Note**
In order to re-use most of the memory of an existing data structure, internal implementation of string is immutable in most programming languages(Java, Python). Take care if you want to modify character in place. 

> When dealing the strings, one usually starts editing from the end of the string and moves to the front. The reason for this is that there are usually enough space at the end of the string. One can modify directly without worrying about covering the previous data.
